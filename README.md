  Building an app to review movie details or search for new movies
</h1>

### I've used basic concepts of React native to build a IMdB type application.

Here is a small introduction to the app and also how to use it.

**

## Introduction

In this app, a **drawer mechanism** is used for the users to navigate to whether they want to search for a specific movie or browse through existing movies.

A simple swipe provides the options to do either.

The **default** mode is set to _search_.

In the **Browse Movies** section, the user simply needs to select a genre of movies which they want to see.

Then, just tapping on _"Search!!"_ will return the results.

</p>

You can also look up the various details of the movies by tapping on any of the search results. So in the example, I've tapped on **"The Dark Knight"** and
hence I'm expecting to see the details of that movie alone.

### Voila!

Now I can see the details of **The Dark Knight** here in the app.

</p>

Tapping on the **search movies** option lets you search for movies with those titles.

For example, here I've searched for the term **"Deadpool"** hence it should return all the movies which have the term **Deadpool** in it.

### Presto!

It does! It puts up a list of all the movies which contain the word "Deadpool" and shows them to the user!

And as with the movie browsing, you can also take a look at the various details offered.

### And that's a general way of how to operate this app, thanks for reading.
